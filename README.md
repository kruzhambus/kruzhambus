# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub account! My name is Maksim Mrug. My main area of expertise is web (React JS).\
Also, I'm interested in anything related to computer science in general, I like to ride a motorcycle and waste my life with Swetrix developers.

## What I work with

I am proficient in several programming languages and technologies, including:
- ReactJS
- JavaScript
- TypeScript
- NodeJS
- NestJS
- Python
- Django

## Notable Projects

I have several notable projects that I would like to highlight, including:
- [swetrix-fe](https://github.com/Swetrix/swetrix-fe)
- [swetrix-api](https://github.com/Swetrix/swetrix-api) - Swetrix is a privacy-oriented, simple and fully cookie-less web analytics service.
It provides lots of metrics like unique visitors, live visitors monitoring, custom events, pageviews and many more.
The service also supports many other features, like dashboard metrics & GDPR exports, email reports and more.
The project's purpose is to fight web analytics giants like Google Analytics while providing better quality and experience of using service.

## Collaboration
